Summary
I want to learn how to create browser applications. 
Nowaday I admire the following project: https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/. 
To have sufficient skills to write such applications requires a lot of experience and knowledge, 
which requires a lot of time and effort. I think that RSS courses give a push in the direction of the goal, the main thing that is required from the student is his desire to achieve the goal and hard work. In addition, with each step, the goals can be changed to more and more large-scale ;)


Skills:
- PHP 5.6+ and bit of framework symfony (routing, controllers)
- JavaScript
- bit of Node.js 
- basics of MySQL/NoSQL and memcached
- basics of html/css

Experience:
- compliting tasks from different sourses (Books, codewars.com)
- compliting rsschool tasks
- making projects on STM board
