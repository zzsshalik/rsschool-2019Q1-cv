      <b>Summary:</b>
      I want to learn how to create browser applications. 
      Nowaday I admire the following project: https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/. 
      To have sufficient skills to write such applications requires a lot of experience and knowledge, 
      which requires a lot of time and effort. I believe that RSS courses give a push in the direction of the goal, the main thing that is required from the student is his desire to achieve the goal and hard work. In addition, with each step, the goals can be changed to more and more large-scale ;)
